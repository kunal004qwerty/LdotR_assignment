Question 03:->
            Write a step-by-step guide to resolve a merge conflict when merging a feature branch into the main branch ?


Answer:->
        step_1  -> Switch To The Main Branch
                -> git checkout main

        step_2  -> Pull The Latest Changes
                -> git pull origin main  

        step_3  -> Merge The Feature Branch (ex-> otherBranch) Into main
                -> git merge otherBranch              

        step_4  -> Identify The Conflict
                -> git status

        step_5  -> Resolve The Conflicts

        step_6  -> Mark the file as resolved
                -> git add <file-name>

        step_7  -> Continue the merge Process
                -> git commit                        

        step_8  -> git push origin main
