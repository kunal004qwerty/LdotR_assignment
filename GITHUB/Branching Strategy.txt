Question 02:->
            Describe a common branching strategy (such as GitFlow or feature branching) used in software development teams and how you would implement it for a new feature ?


Answer:->

        Main Branch (often called master or main)

        step_1 :->  update your current branching
                ->  git checkout main
                ->  git pull origin main

        step_2  -> Create a new branch
                -> git checkout -b otherBranch   

        step_3  -> commit the new feature
                -> git add.
                -> git commit -m "implement new feature"

        step_4  -> push the feature branch to the remote repository
                -> git push -u origin otherBranch
           
        step_5  -> Create a pull request (PR)   

        step_6  -> pull the latest code after code review and merge
                -> git pull origin main
